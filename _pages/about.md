Bytedance Seed-Robotics
------
I primarily focus on research related to robotic manipulation policy, covering areas such as 3D visual perception, vision-language-action models, simulation-to-reality transfer, reinforcement learning, and more. At the same time, I explore the acceleration deployment technology of neural networks on the edge. 


Megvii Research
------
My primary work focuses on developing AI-ISP chip-level algorithm systems, along with Image Signal Processing„ÄÅComputational Photography and Low-level Computer Vision technologies. The multiple chip generations we have developed are already in mass production and widely deployed across consumer electronics, security & surveillance, and autonomous driving.
